## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **AI/ML**: Anomaly detection (future extension)  
- **Other**: Blockchain for secure IDs, Netlify for deployment

## 🧩 How It Works  
1. **Tourists** register and receive a blockchain-based digital ID.  
2. **System monitors** their live location (with consent) and sets safe geo-boundaries.  
3. If a tourist **presses SOS** or enters a danger zone, instant alerts are sent.  
4. **Authorities/Admins** see incidents on a real-time dashboard.  
5. **AI anomaly detection** provides proactive safety signals.
